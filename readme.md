# Next-Gen Industrial Monitoring using AI and Blockchain

## Project Overview
This project leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain** to enhance industrial equipment monitoring through **predictive maintenance**. By analyzing historical and real-time data, AI models can forecast potential failures before they occur. Blockchain ensures **data integrity, transparency, and security** by maintaining an immutable record of maintenance activities.

## Features
- **Predictive Maintenance**: AI-driven failure prediction based on real-time and historical data.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Secure, tamper-proof storage of maintenance records and operational data.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated maintenance alerts and workflow triggers.
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduction in unexpected downtimes and maintenance costs.
- **Improved Equipment Reliability**: Extends asset lifespan through proactive maintenance.

## Technologies Used
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**
  - Data Analytics for Failure Prediction
  - ML Models for Pattern Recognition
- **Blockchain**
  - **Ethereum / Hyperledger Fabric** for decentralized record-keeping
  - Smart Contracts for automated maintenance tasks
- **Development Tools**
  - Python (for AI/ML)
  - Solidity (for Smart Contracts)
  - Web3.js (for Blockchain Integration)
