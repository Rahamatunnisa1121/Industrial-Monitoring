# 🧠 AI Predictive Maintenance Assistant

An interactive web application that uses machine learning to **predict machine failure conditions** and provide **smart maintenance recommendations** in real time. Built with **XGBoost**, **PCA**, and **Streamlit** for user-friendly diagnostics.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Failure Prediction** using a trained XGBoost classifier  
- 🛠️ **Maintenance Advice** tailored to detected machine stress or faults  
- 📊 Handles **multiclass classification (6 classes)** including:
  - Normal Operation
  - Light Stress
  - Medium Stress
  - High Stress
  - Tool Wear
  - Critical Condition  
- 📐 Preprocessing pipeline includes **Scaling**, **PCA**, and **One-hot Encoding**  
- 🌐 Deployed using Streamlit with a **responsive and clean UI**  
- 🧪 Includes example test cases to simulate different failure modes

## 📘 Class Descriptions

| Class | Condition              | Description                                  |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **0** | 🟢 Normal Operation     | No failure detected. Machine is healthy.     |
| **1** | 🟡 Light Stress         | Heat dissipation issues.                     |
| **2** | 🟠 Medium Stress        | Power instability.                           |
| **3** | 🔴 High Stress          | Mechanical overstrain.                       |
| **4** | ⚙️ Tool Wear            | Tool edges worn or misaligned.               |
| **5** | 🔥 Critical Condition   | Major anomaly. Immediate shutdown needed.    |

## 🧠 Sample Maintenance Remedies

Each class includes actionable advice like:

- Clean ventilation and cooling fans  
- Check electrical stability and grounding  
- Reduce load, inspect mechanical connections  
- Inspect/replace worn tools  
- Run full diagnostics for major issues
